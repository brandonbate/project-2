# Project #2

This is a repository for project #2. In this project, you need to create an online gaming platform where users can play live against each other.
Your program should be an ASGI app on Daphne with Redis as the channel backend. The program should serve HTML content that contains javascript.
The javascript code should open a WebSocket to the ASGI app. You should perform visual tasks on the client end via javascript. The server application
should ensure that rule violations are impossible. I will give additional criteria for this assignment later.
